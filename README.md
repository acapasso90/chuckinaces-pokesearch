# The ChuckinAces PokeSearch

This app was built for Chuckinaces on twitch.tv (https://www.twitch.tv/chuckinaces) for their live Pokemon Card Giveaways. It is a search engine built with React that searches pokemon height and weight as well as pokemon card prices. The cards are able to be searched by name, by card set, by subtype, or by rarity. 

This app was built utilizing the PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) and the pokemon tcg api (https://pokemontcg.io/)
